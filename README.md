# ProAdmin
## The Most Powerful Minecraft Server Management Suite
Designed for servers ranging from the humble Vanilla server all the way to massive minigame servers, ProAdmin is packed with power and flexibility. It features a command-line interface for remote connections and a sleek GUI for fast development on your own PC. And because it's written in Java, you can run it on any platform.
#### Currently in development
Altough it's not done yet, I'm working hard to get it finished. I'd like to be able to use it myself (which is where I got the idea), so I have some personal motivation to finish it up. I am currently working on the first beta release which will support only the comand-line, but will be fully functional and will allow for management of your server that will be much faster than manual management. The rest of the beta releases after that will be focused on the GUI. I hope to get it wrapped up and released hopefully within a month, but I can't make any promises.
##### In the meantime, feel free to enjoy the mostly uncommented source code!

## Designed for your PC and for your remote server
Because most big minecraft servers are run on remote servers such as [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) or [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/), ProAdmin features a fully-capable command-line-interface to allow you to manage your server over SSH. In addition, it features the ability to build and run your minecraft server on your local PC using its beautifully crafted graphical interface, then deploy it to your remote server where it can be put into action.
